# Vim Setup

This my vim setup with all the plugins and scripts, a clone to a linux system with latest vim should work fine.

Copy .vimrc to system .vimrc file in the root directory (if not present then create one).

run vim on the shell it will download the required packages

Copy colors/  and scripts/ to the .vim/ created 

run vim again
